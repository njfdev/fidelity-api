# Reverse Engineered Fidelity API

**NOTE: This project was created with good intentions, however, if anyone from Fidelity Investments has an issue with this, please contact me at [contact@njf.dev](mailto:contact@njf.dev).**

---

I created this project once I started using Fidelity Investments and was disappointed to learn that there was not a user-facing application programing interface (API). This project attempts to reverse engineer the internal API used for Fidelity's user-facing website. Contributing to the project is welcomed.

All reversed engineered API documentation is in the [Wiki](../../wiki).
